                                         OIML Foreword
The International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) is a worldwide, intergovernmental organization whose
primary aim is to harmonize the regulations and metrological controls applied by the national metrological
services, or related organizations, of its Member States. The main categories of OIML publications are:

      •     International Recommendations (OIML R), which are model regulations that establish the
            metrological characteristics required of certain measuring instruments and which specify methods
            and equipment for checking their conformity. OIML Member States shall implement these
            Recommendations to the greatest possible extent;

      •     International Documents (OIML D), which are informative in nature and which are intended to
            harmonize and improve work in the field of legal metrology;

      •     International Guides (OIML G), which are also informative in nature and which are intended to give
            guidelines for the application of certain requirements to legal metrology;

      •     International Basic Publications (OIML B), which define the operating rules of the various OIML
            structures and systems; and

OIML Draft Recommendations, Documents and Guides are developed by Project Groups linked to Technical
Committees or Subcommittees which comprise representatives from OIML Member States. Certain international
and regional institutions also participate on a consultation basis. Cooperative agreements have been established
between the OIML and certain institutions, such as ISO and the IEC, with the objective of avoiding contradictory
requirements. Consequently, manufacturers and users of measuring instruments, test laboratories, etc. may
simultaneously apply OIML publications and those of other institutions.

International Recommendations, Documents, Guides and Basic Publications are published in English (E) and
translated into French (F) and are subject to periodic revision.

Additionally, the OIML publishes or participates in the publication of Vocabularies (OIML V) and periodically
commissions legal metrology experts to write Expert Reports (OIML E). Expert Reports are intended to provide
information and advice, and are written solely from the viewpoint of their author, without the involvement of a
Technical Committee or Subcommittee, nor that of the CIML. Thus, they do not necessarily represent the views
of the OIML.

This publication, OIML E 7, edition 2015 (E) – was written by Yasmine Bekkouche and Caroline Jeangeorges,
students of the Paris-based National School of Statistics and Economic Administration under the supervision of
Dr. Valerie Villiere, the CIML Member for Australia.

                 MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT
                      OF LEGAL METROLOGY


This report, commissioned by the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML –
Organisation Internationale de Métrologie Légale), is the result of the collaboration between
the OIML and ENSAE Junior Etude (Yasmine Bekkouche and Caroline Jeangeorges). Its
purpose is to show how important the metrological standards, norms and recommendations
of legal metrology are for producers, consumers and the economy and society at large. We
begin by reviewing some of the literature on the economics of standards and legal metrology.
The bulk of the report is then suggesting a model for assessing and quantifying the economic
benefits of adopting legal metrology standards at the firm, sector and national levels.

If many studies and surveys describe these potential benefits, very few give a reproducible
methodology to quantify precisely the impact of metrology on wealth and value creation. The
difficulty is well known: in the absence of a counterfactual, identifying and modelling the
effects of standard adoption or the return on investments in metrology is a complex matter.
This report examines the literature on that topic (parts I to IV) – though not exhaustively – in
order to determine the different elements to include in our model.

Guidelines for a macro econometric model are put forward, as well as benefits identified in
microeconomic case studies (part V). A theoretical model is then put forward to analyse the
benefits of legal metrology (part VI). Finally we will illustrate this report with a case study
(part VII) evaluating the impact of legal metrology in three Australian sectors: wheat, sugar
and coal. The OIML, through Dr. Valerie Villiere, has followed closely the different steps of the
conception of the report. We would like to thank her and the OIML for their support.
However, any mistakes and imprecisions remain of the authors’ responsibility alone.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The report begins with a literature review centred on the benefits scientific, industrial and
legal metrologies have brought to societies since the 18th century. Works in history,
economics and social sciences are used to understand the social and economic benefits
associated with the construction of an international system of units followed by a global
network of metrological organisations still expanding today.

Moving on to the specialized literature in economics of metrology and standards, Section II
sums up the most generally accepted benefits of every metrology- and standard-related
activity that might be of interest in order to appraise the gains brought by legal metrology
itself. That includes benefits to international trade, which are to a large extent the product of
international harmonization and cooperation in legal metrology. In conclusion of the
literature review, we address the problem of quantifying the economic benefits of legal
metrology by summarizing the different options available and presenting the ISO framework
for identifying the assets in an organisation that legal metrology can be beneficial to.

The third section of the report examines how different measures of the activity of national
metrology organisations are used in the literature to estimate the impact of metrology on
growth and innovation. Those measures include: government spending metrology R&D, stock
of standards, patents and publications and sector-specific advantages. The possibility of using
similar indicators (proxies) for estimating the economic benefits of legal metrology is
discussed, on the basis that standardisation and legal metrology activities such as conformity
assessment involve the same actors and produce comparable benefits. Section III goes on
reviewing a selection of studies on the impact of legal metrology and standardisation on
innovation, aggregate productivity or labour productivity.

Section IV provides some methodological elements for building an econometric model at the
macro level. Various explained variables for the model as well as proxies for legal metrology
activity are discussed. A method is described for an analysis with an international scope.

Section V focuses on the microeconomic benefits of legal metrology underpinning the models
presented in sections III and IV. Benefits for producers and consumers are identified in
sectorial case studies selected in the literature. Such benefits include: reduced transaction
costs (search and information, bargaining, enforcement); increased productivity; access to
new markets; information, quality and price premium. On the consumers’ side, advantages
include: information, quality assurance, new products and network effects.

Section VI presents a theoretical model for for quantifying the gain brought by conformity to
legal metrology requirements to the profits of producers. Drawing from the producer
microeconomic theory, the proposed maximisation programme takes into account the effect
of legal metrology in the objective function of the producer in order to augment its benefits.

OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

Another model is put forward, to help determine to optimal amount of public investment in
metrology and standardisation.

Section VII develops a method to quantify the effects of uniform maximum permissible errors
(MPE) in trade. Impact study on the divergence of MPEs is a way to quantify the economic
benefits of legal metrology. Indeed legal metrology is used to ensure smooth transaction in
trade particularly by fixing MPEs. Two types of divergence of the MPEs between buyer and
seller are examined. The first type is a small deviation in the MPEs that correspond to a
translation of the testing limit of the measurement instrument. This translation leads to
differences in the testing limit for the product traded. The second divergence considered is
the situation where the MPEs are of different magnitudes. In this second case, an economic
loss of 9,299,354 AUD over three industries is found for the hypothetical situation where the
Australian MPEs would be twice higher than the international one.

I)   LEGAL METROLOGY, SOCIETY AND TRADE




     A HISTORY OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS

     For over five millennia, societies have invented and refined means to measure time, weights,
     distances, frequencies, areas. Metrology, in its widest sense, is the science of measurement
     and it is safe to say that is has steadily brought benefits to the economies of all societies. By
     ensuring that the standards we use – ideas and objects we deem good benchmarks – have
     precise values that make them useful for comparison, metrology plays an essential role in our
     economic lives. As the literature on the history of metrology shows, the development of
     metrology systems and legal standards has been instrumental in the expansion of domestic
     and international trade. The need for consistent and reliable measurements is old: ancient
     metrological systems were based on the features of a sovereign (such as the arm length of
     the pharaoh in ancient Egypt), followed precepts in the holy books or royal decrees. With the
     expansions of cities, public infrastructure and manufactured goods, metrology became an
     increasingly important (but not always visible) part of everyday life.

     The importance of accurate and transparent measurement grew again with the standards,
     laws and legal requirements brought by the consolidation of the State in the 18th and 19th
     centuries, as well as with the expansion of industry. In the last decades, following the rapid
     growth of international trade, metrology evolved toward the standardization of measurement
     units and methods in a globalized world. The literature on the development of metrology and
     its history is vast, but a good starting point would be the collective book edited by (Wise
     1997), exploring the rise of quantitative precision as a fundamental value of modern science
     and industry. Other valuable sources on the history of measurement include: (Robinson 2007)
     and (Whitelaw 2007).

     The origin of modern metrology is usually placed in the 18th century in France, with the
     introduction of the decimal metric system (1799), replacing the multitude of different units
     used for local trade. Another key element is of course the industrial revolution of 19th
     century Europe. The metric system became legal in Great Britain in 1864 and was adopted in
     Germany in 1868 (although the UK came short of adopting it, partly because of the powerful
     textile sector, reluctant of the immediate costs). In 1875, the Metre Convention (also known
     as the Treaty of the Metre) was signed in Paris by representatives of 17 nations and quickly
     grew to cover more countries (56 member states in 2014) and areas other than weights and
     measures, such as: electrical standards (1921), photometric standards (1927), ionizing
     radiation standards (1960s), time standards (1987), chemistry metrology (1993) and, finally,
     metrology in all scientific areas (1999).

     At the same time, as metrological activities grew in scope and volume, their classification
     evolved:


                                                    9
OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

“One institutional aspect of the development of metrology in the 20th century was the
separation of metrology in many countries into scientific metrology, led by the National
Metrology Institutes, and practical or legal metrology, administered by weights and measures
authorities” (Birch 2003).

THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF METROLOGY ORGANISATIONS

The 1875 Convention also institutes the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures or
International Bureau of Weights and Measures), designed – after some controversy at the
time 1 – as an international scientific organisation supported by member states for the
purpose of carrying out scientific work related to metrology, instruments and units. This was,
one might observe, a way to maintain metrology for science and metrology for Law and trade
separate; the latter deserving perhaps more diplomatic attention since it influenced directly
international trade and relations between member states.

Legal metrology has evolved to cover the “practice and process of applying statutory and
regulatory structure and enforcement to metrology” (i.e measurement, units of
measurement, measuring instruments and methods of measurement (OIML 2011).

The BIPM was created along two other international institutions under the Metre Convention:
the General Conference on Weights and Measures (Conférence générale des poids et
mesures, CGPM) and the International Committee for Weights and Measures (Comité
international des poids et mesures, CIPM). A number of National Metrology Institutes (NMI)
was established in Europe in the following years. The Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt
(PTR), created in 1887 in Berlin, was the first national standards laboratory. In 1960, the
International System of Units (SI system) replaced the original system of the Convention, but
kept its fundamental units (Metre, Kilogram, Second, Ampere) and adding the Kelvin and the
Candela.

We have seen that the development of metrology coincided with the emergence of modern
science: an international network of scientists producing comparable and reproducible
results, and that a branch of metrology specialised as such. But it is also is closely linked to the
industrial revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries and the development of manufacturing
techniques for mass production. Indeed, as (Quinn and Kovalevsky 2005) put it:

       “The rapid development of manufacturing technology during the first half of the
       nineteenth century was accompanied by, and in fact could hardly have taken place
       without, a corresponding development in the design and manufacture of measuring
       machines, standardization of screw threads and indeed such basic things as
       engineering flat surfaces and straight edges, all of which are essential for precision
       manufacturing on a large-scale.”

Aside from everyday life, science and industry, improvements in metrology provided
important advantages to national and international trade. Aside from accompanying advances
in production and quality, metrological developments were also historically designed to
ensure fair trade. Indeed, the State, by safeguarding the quality of measuring instruments and
the comparability of units, lowered the costs associated with disputes and technical barriers
to trade (TBT). As we will see, this aspect has expanded to most trade operations and is still a
critical function of legal metrology today, in the public as in the private sector. After all, trade
depends on units of mass, length and volume at a fundamental level since their measurement
determines the price. But the economic benefits of investing in metrology and standards are
not limited to quantitative precision.

II)   IDENTIFYING THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS OF METROLOGICAL SYSTEMS


      FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN THE LITERATURE

      As we have seen, metrology played a central role in the expansion of mass manufacturing. For
      many authors, it can thus be considered an essential requirement for an effective division of
      labour. Indeed, the division of labour depends on formal and informal norms and standards
      so as to make possible the optimal intervention of multiple agents on the same production
      chain. (Barber 1987) notes that a lack of widely accepted measurement standards results in
      higher transaction costs, meaning that companies will do things in-house rather than
      outsourcing tasks to more efficient specialists, hence losing the benefits of the division of
      labour.

      The benefits of measurement innovation, combined to legal metrology standards, also show
      up as an increase in productivity. Various authors cite benefits to productivity stemming from
      the metrological added value to integrated process control [(Dunn 2005) and (Johnson 2006)],
      reduced costs of meeting regulation or better decision-making (Swann 2009), p.46-47). But
      the oldest beneficial effect of improved measurement standards on productivity to have been
      identified is certainly the production of interchangeable parts. Thomas Jefferson observed
      this in 1875 when visiting France:

                  “An improvement is made here in the construction of muskets, which it may be
                  interesting to Congress to know …. It consists in the making every part of them so
                  exactly alike, that what belongs to any one, may be used for every other musket in the
                  magazine … I put several together myself, taking pieces at hazard as they came to
                  hand, and they fitted in the most perfect manner. The advantage of this when arms
                  need repair are evident. He effects it by tools of his own contrivance, which, at the
                  same time, abridge the work, so that he thinks he shall be able to furnish the musket
                  two livres cheaper than the common price”

      By reducing the barriers to entry and representing the interests of producers, consumers and
      other stakeholders, open standards are also thought to increase competition (Swann 2009).
      By promoting new entrants and increasing competitive pressure on incumbent companies,
      metrological standards also foster innovation. As P. Swann also notes, widely accepted
      metrological standards also help innovative companies prove the benefits of new products by
      providing recognized standards for consumers to compare to. Indeed:

                  “If the innovator cannot achieve a premium for his innovations, then the economic
                  incentive for innovation may be lost.” 2

Many authors have underlined the importance of trust in economic transactions – indeed; the
entire economic circuit is based on some level of trust between agents. A substantial part of
that vital element of trade is provided by an international network of certifications and
standards, in turn relying on metrology organisations and metrological systems. In economic
terms, metrology – and legal metrology in particular – mitigates the effects of information
asymmetry. If the seller knows more about the product being sold than does the buyer, the
lack of trust in the transaction can lead to dramatic market failures, such as honest sellers
being driven out of the market. This is reminiscent of Gresham’s Law: when the “real” value
of a commodity shows a significant difference with the value people are required to accept,
“bad products” will drive out “good products”. This information asymmetry problem was
famously illustrated in (Akerlof 1970), in an article about lemons on the second-hand car
market. By ensuring that buyers and sellers both benefit from reliable metrological
information, as well as requiring that sellers are submitted to relevant standard comparisons,
legal metrology mitigates that risk. Also, standards can be considered as a form of technology
infrastructure that enables technology-based growth (Tassey 2000). Improved measurement
methods for research and development, performance verification, process control, and
efficiency in market transactions foster innovation and technology diffusion as well.

Investments in metrology and standards also generate spill-over benefits at the firm level,
such as more effective stock control or the limitation of fraud (Birch 2003). One very
comprehensive book on the economics of standardization is (Blind 2004). The book provides a
complete outline of the various types of standards and their possible economic impact. The
links between standards, technological change, innovation and the regulatory system is also
explored.

BENEFITS TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE

In today’s globalized trade environment, legal metrology organizes the access to markets and
provides a level playing field for businesses. Additionally, international compatibility, quality
or measurement standards promote trade by lowering transaction costs, increasing consumer
confidence or disseminating knowledge (CIE 2006). But the most prominent benefits legal
metrology brings to international trade are expressed in terms of access to markets: the
removal of non-tariff, Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). It is the task of the OIML to facilitate
the removal of TBT by harmonizing metrological requirements at the international level
without hindering the development of free trade. Indeed, as (Kochsiek and Odin 2001) put it:

       “Reliable and comparable measurements play an important role in many cases for the
       requirements to be met by the products and services (which may be different in the
       individual states), as do the various approval and test methods laid down by the
       responsible authorities. But the latter may themselves turn into barriers to trade,
       defeating the object of the exercise.”

OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

International and regional organisations concerned with metrology and conformity
assessment, recognizing the new challenges posed by the rapid globalization of trade, have
begun cooperation. Most have also published strategy papers on the subject (e.g. the “Blevin
report” (BIPM 1998) for the Metre Convention and the “Birkeland study” (Birkeland 1998) for
the OIML). Metrology organisations have cooperation agreements with the main international
trade organisations, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The WTO “TBT agreement”
provides advice to metrologists on harmonisation and requires national technical regulations
to be transparent, justifiable and non-discriminatory. Other cooperation initiatives include
meetings with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and
joint workshops on metrology with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
(UN/ECE).

Harmonizing the technical regulations to facilitate world trade is also the role of the BIPM. A
major advance in the removal of TBT was made in Paris during the 21th CGPM (the General
Conference of the Metre Convention or Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures), on
October 14, 1999 when representatives from 38 national metrology institutes (NMIs) and two
international organizations signed a Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). The “CIPM
MRA” – its full title being Mutual recognition of national measurement standards and of
calibration and measurement certificates issued by national metrology institutes – specifies
that NMIs can become a part of an international network of metrological bodies producing
reliable and comparable results either by self-declaration and disclosure of their means and
methods, or by formal accreditation by competent authorities.

The international network of metrological organisations ensures precision in demonstrating
conformity to written standards or specifications. Those are often the result of the political
process of government, even if the border between public and private standards is often
unclear as many standards are public by law but are based on the work of private standard-
setting organisations (WTO 2005). Legal metrology thus forms a network connecting
international organisations, political decision-making at the national level and virtually all
economic agents. In that sense, legal metrology can be seen as a link between the political
and economic fields.

This element is also important for it helps economic agents benefit from network effects.
A network technology is a technology where users benefit not only from its inherent value but
also from the size of the community of users. Two “laws” of economics illustrate this
mechanism: Metcalfe’s Law (regarding telecommunication networks) and Reed’s Law (the
utility of large networks, and specifically social networks, scales exponentially with the size of
the network). The more widely accepted standards are established for, say, connectivity in
electronics, telecommunication frequencies or content format such as Blu-Ray discs (JSA
2005), the more the community of users benefit from those technologies.

QUANTIFYING THE BENEFITS OF LEGAL METROLOGY

In order to design effective tools for assessing the economic benefits of legal metrology, we
must know exactly where to look. At a basic level, metrology is usually divided into three main
categories. Scientific metrology maintains and develops accurate standards; Industrial
metrology cares for measuring instruments used in production and testing processes, as well
as measurements for quality of life and academic research; finally, Legal metrology ensures
adequate measurements where they influence the transparency and quality of economic
transactions. Such situations include instruments subject to specific legal requirements or the
need for measurement traceability. Indeed, one of the core functions of legal metrology is to
provide the necessary infrastructure for the traceability of regulated measurements and
measuring instruments.

Legal metrology provides methods and guidelines for maintaining the material conditions for
trust and confidence in economic transactions through its international recommendations
and its compliance and enforcement programmes. In metrological terms, a crucial part of this
system is referred to as the “traceability chain”: an unbroken chain of comparisons, going
back to one or more fundamental standards. Such a device requires good communication
between multiple actors involved in metrological activities: standards-setting, accreditation,
instrument testing, measurement etc. The traceability chain is established through mutual
recognition agreements or arrangements (for example the CIPM MRA and the ILAC MRA, the
arrangement between accreditation laboratories) as well as peer-review.

In order to facilitate conformity to standards and limit uncertainty in measurement results,
legal metrology organisations use reference procedures. Such procedures are used to
characterise reference materials or to define reference values. The former are used to
measure a certain quality in a commodity, as a parameter of its price. Reference quantity
values serve the purpose of establishing a maximum permissible measurement error. Both
elements are translated into legal standards for producing and selling, and are thus
embedded in virtually all value-creating processes. The volume and density of such legal
metrology standards (or “stock” of standards) are sometimes used as a proxy to assess the
level of investment of a given region, country, industry or firm in legal metrology and the
benefits that it entails.

Maintaining a solid and metrological infrastructure, in collaboration with international
authorities in metrology, and translating this operation in laws for trade, production or safety
is a process that involves every part of public life. It is thus understandable that quantifying
the benefits of legal metrology and providing tools readily available to decision-makers for the
assessment of the benefits of metrology research or investment is not an easy matter. In the
literature on the economics of measurement, different approaches to calculating the benefits
of legal metrology have been used or suggested:

   •   Measuring the added value of government-financed metrology research programmes;
   •   Using the stock of standards as a proxy for standardization or the activity of
       metrological institutes;
   •   Using patents and publications in metrology as a proxy for metrology investment and
       activity;
   •   Conducting sectoral case studies to identify industry-specific drivers of growth;
   •   Using specific guidelines produced by standard-setting organisations to assess the
       benefits of legal metrology standards.

   Overall, all studies have concluded that there is a clear economic benefit in investing in
   metrology programmes and national metrology institutes (Kaarls 2003) p.118.

THE ISO METHODOLOGY

Assessing and communicating the benefits of standardization is paramount for standard-
setting organisations. The International Standards Organisation (ISO) has published a broad
methodology to evaluate the impact of standards on value creation (ISO 2010). ISO set up a
basic framework to represent the value chain in most business-oriented organisations, and
allow for the identification of where and how standards affect the creation of value.

Figure 1: Model Value Chain in ISO 2010 p.3

The ISO methodology relies on a “Standard Impact Map”, which “lists the generic impacts
from standards” by business function in the value chain. Other tools are then used to place
the organisation in its industry or sector and understand the specific impacts of standards
that may occur there, as well as to produce a valuation of generic standards in their own
context.

III)   MEASURING THE IMPACT OF LEGAL METROLOGY ON GROWTH


       LEGAL METROLOGY, STANDARDS AND INNOVATION

       It is fair to say that achieving a direct and perfect measure of the intensity of legal metrology
       activity is not possible, for it is too closely intertwined with every economic process. In
       addition the practice of legal metrology is closely linked to scientific and industrial metrology.
       As Paul Temple (Temple 2009) puts it:

       “As formal written documents, standards provide codified information regarding measures,
       reference materials, and processes which frequently support the other functions of
       standards, e.g. in the provision of legal metrology.”

        Indeed, defining norms and requirements regarding measuring instruments for trade and
       ensuring that those are followed relies on scientific and industrial metrology. In addition
       those norms will be highly dependent upon the current industrial standards. Using proxy to
       estimate the economic impact of legal metrology is however possible. For instance using the
       budget of the national institutes that are in charge of defining and enforcing those norms can
       be a relevant strategy to estimate legal metrology’s impact. Evidently it does not account for
       how adequately this money is spent and its actual contribution to the effectiveness and
       reliability of legal metrology. Legal metrology involves the same actors as the process of
       standardization does, and its benefits to the economy and society are of the same nature as
       those of standardization. Standardization brings benefit to the economy by stimulating
       innovation and productivity. Legal metrology ensures that those benefits are realised through
       assessment of conformity to legal requirements derived from standards. Consequently,
       studying the methods for quantifying the impact of standardization on the economy is a good
       starting point to estimate the benefits of legal metrology. The stock of standards produced
       and the amount of publications by national metrology institutes are good proxies for their
       activity. Ultimately, such measures are used to analyse the benefits of standardization. The
       next section will present some of the works that have been done to estimate the economic
       impact of standardization since the same methods can be used to identify the economic
       benefits of legal metrology.

       Developing and implementing standards as well as investing more in national metrology
       institutions must be justified by the benefits it entails. Some types of benefits, such as an
       improvement in quality of life, can be difficult to measure but may be the most central
       contributions of standards to society. It is delicate to obtain a value properly evaluating the
       benefits of good air quality or trust and confidence in a business environment, for example.
       Many studies focus on the benefits of legal metrology at an aggregate level. These studies
       usually concentrate on the relationship between macroeconomic variables such as the
       average aggregate labour and capital productivity and the stock of standards or government
       spending in metrology-related institutions.



                                                      18
                                 OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

The main idea behind this type of estimation is that the development of standards and the
work of national metrology institutes drive innovation and productivity. Increases in
innovation and productivity can be translated in terms of GDP points since they tend to boost
production, exports and trade. The “BERL report” for example (Stokes, Dixon et al. 2011),
states that the development of standards helped achieve an additional 564 million of New
Zealand dollars in export volume, corresponding to an increase of 0.8 percent of the total
volume of exports.

The link between legal metrology and innovation is made clear in many publications. The
product of the work of legal metrology institutes, standards and publications regarding legal
metrology requirements, can be decisive to innovation activities for various reasons. In the
Schumpeterian view of progress, there are three key concepts when dealing with
technological change: invention, innovation and diffusion. Standards play a role in all of these
mechanisms. First of all, as described in the BERL study, a standard is a vessel for knowledge
and technology diffusion. The information embodied in a standard can belong to industry
process optimization, resource use monitoring or product safety best practices. Standards can
ensure the diffusion of new technologies, new products or new ideas as explained in the “CIE
study” (CIE 2006) where the authors consider standards as a language:

       “The process of writing a standard — engaging committee members, preparing drafts,
       coming to consensus (in the approach that Standards Australia uses) is a process of
       distilling a variety of knowledge and practical experience into a document or set of
       documents that can be used and understood.”

In order to have a positive effect on economic development B. Verlag (Verlag 2000) states
that:

       “New products and improved methods of production must quickly assert themselves
       as broadly as possible”.

In addition to supplying a vessel to diffuse innovation, standards can enable innovation, as P.
Swann puts it, by helping “create a strong, open, and well-organized technological
infrastructure that will serve as a foundation for innovation-led growth” (Swann 2000). New
technologies or new processes can be built on this foundation.

However, when considering legal metrology activity and innovation one must not forget that
a positive correlation is not obvious. Indeed if we consider legal metrology, many authors
have remarked upon the fact that standards can also hinder innovation. When observing the
link between innovation or technological change and metrology, the timing of metrology
work is paramount: if introduced too early, standards can prevent innovations to enter the
market. In addition to this timing issue, the number of standards in a certain sector can also
play against innovation (Stokes, Dixon et al. 2011).

In the 2005 DTI study (DTI 2005), P. Swann focused on the following question: “Do standards
enable innovation?” Using data from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), he was able to

                                              19
OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

question the informative role of standards and whether they exert a constraint on innovation.
The PERINORM dataset contains information on the stock of standards, particularly its size
and its median age. Combining those two datasets, P. Swann used two ordered logit models:
one estimating the informative role of standards, and one estimating the constraints
standards put on innovation. If we consider the result about the constraint on innovation, it
appears that the relationship is non-monotonous: when the number of standards increases,
producers find them less constraining but after a certain point they become more restrictive.
It appears to be the same with the age of the standards stock relevant to a specific industry.

Legal metrology and standards can be drivers of technological growth and stimulate GDP, but
must be meted out carefully so as not to hinder innovative activities and growth. The studies
linking aggregated variables, such as total factor productivity and a measure of legal
metrology activity, do not presume of the sign of the relation between those variables, but
merely observe what emerges from the data. The aim of the following section is to review
some papers studying the impact of standards at a national level and how the activities of
national and international standards-setting authorities have an impact on innovation,
productivity, growth and social welfare.

In the next section, we will review different approaches. Some estimate the link at the
macroeconomic level between the stock of standards, NMI publications and the aggregate
average labour productivity. These kinds of studies allow for a monetary evaluation of the
economic value of standards and of the work of NMIs. We will first consider the studies that
associate the stock of standards to productivity or directly to GDP. We conclude this section
by considering studies of the impact of public spending in legal metrology and metrology in
general.

EMPIRICAL ESTIMATIONS USING THE STOCK OF STANDARDS

From one study to another, the stock of published standards may be used as a proxy for the
activity of National Metrology Institutes or for the degree of standardization. The advantage
of this measure is that it is available for an extended period of time. Hence its relation to GDP,
growth or total factor productivity can be estimated with time series analysis. As we explained
before, a literature review of this type of study is pertinent when studying legal metrology
since the economic benefits are similar. In addition, since there is a large number of studies
on this subject, there seem to be a consensus that time series analysis is relevant to estimate
the benefits of standardization and the work of metrology institutes.

The study developed by (Jungmittag, Blind et al. 1999) introduces the stock of standards in the
production function and investigates its effect on the output. A co-integration analysis is used
for German data from 1961 to 1996. Their results indicate that the stock of standards does
have an effect on aggregate activity and on economic growth. The DIN study, also using
German data, finds a positive influence of the stock on standard on innovation and on the
economy as a whole (Verlag 2000).


                                               20
                                       OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

The DTI study of 2005 reproduces the methodology used by Jungmittag et al. on U.K data,
from 1948 to 2002 (DTI 2005). This paper associates, with a production function, a set of
inputs to a measure of standardization and to the output. The inputs used are the ones
traditionally considered: capital and labour. The authors use a Cobb Douglas production
function, classically used in growth studies. Technological change acts as a multiplicative
factor of the traditional inputs:

                                               𝑌𝑌 = 𝐴𝐴(𝑡𝑡)𝐾𝐾 𝛼𝛼 𝐿𝐿𝛽𝛽

Where A(t) is technological change and K and L respectively capital and labour inputs.
Technological change is a vector of Z(t), a series of factors containing the stock of standards:

                                              𝐴𝐴(𝑡𝑡) = 𝐴𝐴�𝑍𝑍(𝑡𝑡)�

With A defined as a multiplicative factor. Technological change is also a vector of domestic
innovative activities and the import of technology from abroad. The stock of standards is a
good measure of the diffusion of innovation.

                             𝑍𝑍(𝑡𝑡) = exp(𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆) 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑡𝑡)𝛾𝛾 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(𝑡𝑡)𝛿𝛿 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝜖𝜖

Where Pat(t) is the stock of domestic patents at time t, Lex(t) is the imports of license and
STD(t) is the effective stock of standards. If we apply a logarithmic transformation to the
variables (lower case letters), the production function becomes:

          𝑦𝑦(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿(𝑡𝑡) + 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖(𝑡𝑡) + 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 + 𝑢𝑢(𝑡𝑡)

In that study, the estimations with the complete model were considered inadequate due to
the large number of parameters to estimate. One issue was that standards and patents were
highly co-linear. Consequently, the authors worked on a reduced form, imposing constant
return to scale and linking labour productivity to the labour and capital inputs and only the
stock of standards to model technological change. Here the imposition of constant return to
scale is 𝛽𝛽 = 1 − 𝛼𝛼. So the model estimated is now:

                   𝑦𝑦(𝑡𝑡) − 𝑙𝑙(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝛼𝛼�𝑘𝑘(𝑡𝑡) − 𝑙𝑙(𝑡𝑡)� + 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 + 𝑢𝑢(𝑡𝑡)

Following this estimation the authors produced a co-integration analysis to see if the relations
they estimated were spurious. Their results suggest that the stock of standards did influence
labour productivity, and not the opposite. They found that a one percent increase in the stock
of standards is associated with a 0.05 % increase in productivity.

This type of study was reproduced in many different countries. Haimowitz and Warren used a
similar analysis on Canadian data and also obtained a positive relationship between the stock
of standards and labour productivity (Haimowitz and Warren 2007). Their results are similar to
those of the DTI study. A 2009 report for AFNOR (Miotti 2009) used this model on French
data, the difference being that total factor productivity (TFP) was considered instead of labour
productivity only. The stock of patents is also used in this regression and they find a larger


                                                        21
OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

effect of the stock of standards. In Australia, the Centre for International Economics (CIE) also
obtained results suggesting a positive effect of the standards on productivity (CIE 2006).

However, the authors generally mention that these results must be taken with caution since
the tests applied to the data are imperfect and do not prevent from estimating spurious
relationships. Spurious relationships can occur for different reasons: missing variables
affecting both the stock of standards and productivity but unrelated to legal metrology,
reverse causality problems or simultaneity issues. This study also presents a variation of the
model used previously where the stocks of standards and R&D constitute the stock of
knowledge. They use different computation of this stock of knowledge, using these two
variables. In their second approach, it is the effect of the stock of knowledge on TFP that is
estimated. It is, as they explain, not equivalent to introducing both the stock of standards and
R&D in the regression.

The study is reproduced for New Zealand (Stokes, Dixon et al. 2011) and also estimates, with a
Cobb Douglas production function, the effect of the stock of standards on total factor
productivity from 1950 to 2011. The estimated impact of an increase of one percent in the
stock of standards is associated with an increase of 0.10 % in productivity. Finally, in 2013,
Spencer and Temple produced the same type of analysis but this time only considering the
British Standards Institution (BSI) catalogue, to examine the role of one particular organization
on aggregate productivity. They began by estimating an unrestricted VAR model (Vector
AutoRegressive) and then performed co-integration tests. They also found that standards play
a significant role in long term productivity growth. One of their important results is that
standards would not be affected by short term productivity growth, suggesting that for these
data there are no issues of reverse causality.

These reports surveying the relation between the stock of standards and productivity growth
present some interesting results. The net advantage of using this type of data and
methodology is that it provides a sufficient number of points to estimate a satisfactory
econometric model. However, if the aim is to study the benefits of legal metrology, the stock
of standards is an imperfect proxy. It can give some indication of the impact of legal
metrology activities but quantification will necessarily be imperfect since the proxy doesn’t
entirely covers the benefits of trade regulation based on those standards. Surveys of key
stakeholders can provide comprehensive results on how legal metrology can benefit the
economy at large, but estimating an economic impact in term of GDP may be more difficult. It
is however possible to analyse the benefits of public spending in metrology institutes or by
focusing on certain metrology programs. The following section presents a selection of such
studies.

SPENDING IN METROLOGY AND AGGREGATE PRODUCTIVITY

In 1999, the National Measurement System Policy Unit of the Department of Trade and
Industry commissioned a study on the economic benefits of the National Measurement
System (NMS) in the U.K. (DTI 1999). We must underline that some of the programs covered

                                               22
                                 OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

by the National Measurement System are qualified as falling under legal metrology (DTI
1999). The researchers used survey data but also presented an estimation in GDP terms of
the benefits associated with metrology as a whole. It found that the UK NMS impacts
positively the economy through four main channels: by maintaining the measurement
infrastructure, by supporting innovation, by enabling fair and safe competition and by
representing the UK in international coordination of the measurement systems. The approach
used here consists in determining first which proportion of GDP growth can be attributed to
TFP growth. Then the proportion of TFP growth due to knowledge growth is calculated. Finally
the proportion of knowledge growth due to metrology inputs is allocated. These successive
allocations authorises estimates of the contribution of metrology inputs to GDP growth.

In order to realize such allocations, the authors reviewed extensively the relevant literature.
They estimate that 20 % to 25 % of GDP growth can be allocated to TFP growth. 60 % of
available knowledge comes from domestic sources and the authors assessed that 10 % of this
knowledge can be attributed to metrology inputs. The computed estimate of the impact of
metrology on GDP in the UK is thus, from 1990 to 1998, £5 billion per year (in 1995 prices)
which amounts to 0.8 % of GDP. Another study on the U.K (NMO 2009) develops a method to
estimate the impact on the U.K economy of increasing the budget of the National
Measurement System by 10 %. It is assumed that the purchase of instruments, of technical
standards and the volume of expert services offered vary proportionately with this budget.
Using results concerning the elasticity of productivity with the level of innovation and the
elasticity of innovation to measurement knowledge, an increase of 10 % in the budget of the
National Measurement System would lead to economic gain between 300 and 400 million of
pounds. Bowns et al. (2003) analyse the Mapping Measurement Impact model (MMI) of the
U.K which consists in a method to evaluate the benefits of publicly financed programs. They
describe and analyse the improvement made to this program which is used by the UK DTI to
evaluate the project funded as part the British National Measurement System (NMS).

(Poposki, Majcen et al. 2009) develop an original approach by using data on the sales of
measurement instruments. This paper evaluates whether the countries that have a better
quality of life, using the Human Development Index (HDI) as a proxy, spend also more on
measurements. They find a positive correlation between those two variables. Following this
they put forward descriptive statistics concerning public spending in metrology for a few
European countries in the form of their NMIs budgets. They analyse these data against the
national HDI.

Majcen et al. 2009).

The authors proceed to use the internationally recognized calibration and measurement
capabilities (CMC), defined by the Mutual Recognition Arrangement, of each National
Metrology Institute estimating that they constitute a better proxy for public spending in
metrology. They stipulate that it is still an imperfect measure of public spending since the
costs of maintaining a number of CMC may vary from one CMC to another. More investment
in R&D in metrology is associated with higher HDI. These authors explain that the evaluation
of the benefits one can expect from spending in metrology will probably increase in the
following year since the social demand for government accountability is increasing.

This demand for more evaluation of the benefits associated with spending is illustrated by the
European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) set up by EURAMET, the association of
European NMIs. Indeed, there is a greater demand for ex-ante and ex-post evaluation of the
benefits associated with the allocation of money between different projects in order to
prioritize and ultimately guide the allocation of public funds.

IV)   GUIDELINES FOR AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS AT THE MACRO LEVEL:

      There are a number of macroeconomic studies putting forward a model for estimating the
      impact of standards on productivity and growth. Here, we will present a simple version of the
      macroeconomic model and its possible extensions depending on the data available.

      To perform this type of estimation we either need data from a large number of countries or
      time series for at least one country. The model is usually designed for a single country and
      estimated for a period between ten and sixty years. The objective here is to explain a
      macroeconomic aggregate (productivity, growth, added value) with explanatory variables that
      include an acceptable proxy for legal metrology in order to quantify the impact of this factor.
      To properly identify this impact, control variables have to be included in the model: namely
      the national stock of capital and the amount of labour put in the production. The basic
      version of the model is given by:

                                  𝑦𝑦(𝑡𝑡) = 𝛾𝛾 + 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿(𝑡𝑡) + 𝜖𝜖

      Where 𝑘𝑘 is the stock of capital at time 𝑡𝑡, 𝑙𝑙 the stock of labour at time 𝑡𝑡 and 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(𝑡𝑡)a proxy for
      legal metrology at the same time.

      The first methodological choice to consider is the explained variable. It depends on what we
      seek to know: do we want to quantify an impact on total factor productivity, on labour or
      capital productivity, on sectorial growth, on national growth, on global growth, on social
      welfare (using the HDI index, for example)? To choose this variable, the scale at which the
      analysis is realized must be decided: a sector, a country, a group of countries etc. In most
      studies, productivity is examined at a national level (TFP or labour productivity).

      The second methodological choice is the proxy for legal metrology. The most widely used is
      some variation of the stock of standards, although it is imperfect in a number of ways (see
      beginning of Section III). However this variable presents different advantages: it is easy to
      compute because different organizations keep track of this stock. Besides, it is often available
      for long periods of time. An alternative is to use the number of publications of metrological
      institutes in addition to this stock. Another interesting variable concerning legal metrology
      would be the national budget of metrological institutes or the public spending on that matter.
      We can also use the certification cost for industries (Usuda and Henson 2012) along with the
      precedent proxies. However this operation should be done with caution to avoid any possible
      omitted variable bias. Such bias occurs when factors influence both the explained variable
      and at least one explanatory variable. So, when adding public spending in metrology, one
      must be sure that it is not correlated with an omitted variable that would affect the explained
      variable (i.e. productivity or output).

      The missing variable bias is an inherent problem to this kind of estimation and it is very likely
      that the model with only the stock of standards also suffers from it. Indeed it is very likely that
      the stock of standard and the explained variable are both strongly correlated to innovation


                                                          25
OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

and technological change. Proxies for innovation should thus be added in the model and
many authors do so (cf. part III). The estimated equation becomes:

                    𝑦𝑦(𝑡𝑡) = 𝛾𝛾 + 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) + 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿(𝑡𝑡) + 𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙ℎ(𝑡𝑡) + 𝜖𝜖

Where 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ(𝑡𝑡) is a proxy for technological progress at time 𝑡𝑡. Such proxies can include the
stock of domestic or imported patents, spending in R&D, performances in research and
education etc.

The model can be extended for more than one country, as done in (Temple, Blind et al. 2005).
Estimating the model for multiple countries allows for the introduction of country-fixed
effects coefficients. Including those reduces the omitted variable bias since they control for
unobserved effects constant over time. For 𝑛𝑛 countries, the model is now:

                 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝛽𝛽𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙ℎ𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖

Where 𝑖𝑖 indicates the country.

Once estimated, the model could be a useful addition to the toolbox already available to
researchers and decision makers who seek to assess the impact of legal metrology on the
economy and society. The estimated coefficient 𝛿𝛿 represents the effect, all things being
equal, of legal metrology on the national product.

V)   LESSONS LEARNED FROM SECTORIAL CASE STUDIES

     In order to better apprehend the benefits of legal metrology, the next section analyses the
     microeconomic foundations of the models explained before. More specifically, we will
     describe the benefits of metrology and standardisation for microeconomic actors by focusing
     on sectorial studies and theoretical microeconomic analyses of standardisation impact. The
     scope is twofold: after summarising the main benefits from the producers’ point of view, we
     will point out the gains for consumers mentioned in the literature. More often, the sectorial
     studies on that topic do not give any numerical estimation of the benefits of legal metrology
     or standardisation at large. Indeed, this estimation is not easy to produce because of the lack
     of a counter-factual. Even though, the authors provide a fairly exhaustive list of these
     advantages and explain the underlying mechanisms behind the link between metrology, and
     its translation into legal requirements, and welfare.



     BENEFITS FOR PRODUCERS


     TRANSACTION COSTS REDUCTION

     Transaction costs refer to the costs incurred when making an economic transaction. They also
     refer to the price agents need to pay in order to enter a market. These costs can incur at each
     step of the transaction: before the transaction, search and information costs refer to the costs
     of looking for a potential buyer for second-hand goods, for instance. During the transaction,
     bargaining costs relate to the costs of establishing a contract and making the transaction
     happen (for example, transportation of the goods). After the transaction, policing and
     enforcement costs refer to all the costs of verifying that every Party comply with the contract.

     Businesses have to minimize such costs when working together. They must find a contract in
     their best interest and make sure everything takes place according to the terms defined
     beforehand. Even if the contract builds a legal obligation, one cannot be certain of the other
     Parties’ behaviour. This uncertainty is a market failure in the extent that uncertainty often
     leads to an equilibrium different from the economic optimum. For example we can imagine
     two economic agents willing to make a deal but deciding not to in order to prevent
     themselves from a risk of non-compliance.

     The Case study led by BERL Economics (Stokes, Dixon et al. 2011) is a good example of how
     standards can help mitigate this risk and the associated costs. The study concentrates on the
     building construction sector in New Zealand. Interviews with the main stakeholders of the
     industry were undertaken to assess the role of standard, in reducing cost and uncertainty.
     There is a wide range of standards in this industry ranging from process specifications to
     performance requirements. These standards can be either mandatory or voluntary. The
     revision of one of these standards (NZS 3910:2003) included provisions for “the clear
     identification of risk allocation, assurance of fair treatment for the contractor and the principal


                                                     27
OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

and clearer insurance requirements”. Indeed, stakeholders in the building sector face a high
uncertainty; the Principal could suffer from the delay in the execution of the project. At the
same time, the contractor could suffer from an environmental or climate risk and could not
be held responsible for the delay. The standards make clear who has to carry the risk:

       “The key things the Standards does is that it says, once the project starts most things
       that happen are at the contractor’s risk. They are on-site and know the business of
       construction, so a Standard like that passes the care of the works to the contractor but
       it can’t pass all that risk as there are certain things that the principal must carry – the
       accepted risks – things like the design works, decisions that have been made about the
       materials that will be used. The principal carries this risk as they made that decision.
       These risks also include things that the contractor can’t take out insurance to protect
       themselves from. Those care of the works provisions are a large part of the Standard.”

(Interview quote from Andrew Bricknell, Director of Project Management Asia-Pacific, MWH)

Additionally, the standards not only focus on the aspect of responsibility but are also
“solution-driven” in the extent that they disseminate expectations on payment delivery and
timing and suggest solutions in the case of non-compliance with the contract.

Standards also lead to a reduction of searching costs, which can occur at all stages of the
transaction: they represent the cost of finding a contractor and verifying he is acting
accordingly to the contract. (Den Butter and Groot 2007) describe mechanisms by which
standards reduce transaction costs. Without any specification of product, the search for a
good seller would take a lot of time. Besides, the contract would have to describe every
characteristics of the traded good or service without being able to refer to any known
category. Standards thus allow focusing only on the price and delivery conditions during the
information search but also during the contract redaction. This leads to an important
decrease in transaction costs. Butter et. al. illustrate this standard benefit with an example in
the automobile industry:

       “After standards were introduced, it was no longer necessary to search for a supplier
       that could produce the parts that were needed in a specific situation. Search costs
       decreased and using external suppliers became more profitable. Apart from search
       costs, contracting costs were also reduced. Contracts between the producer and its
       suppliers did no longer have to be specified extensively. Clearly this also reduced
       enforcement costs.”

PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE

In a 2009 study, Swann (Swann 2009) explains how a better knowledge of raw products
induced by legal metrology requirements and standardisation lead to cost reduction and
increased productivity. A case study of Plasterboard production in the UK shows how
standards can enhance the production process. Plasterboard is produced from paper and


                                               28
                                      OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

gypsum. A good measurement of the raw materials and of the intermediate products allows
adjusting the production process. This is all the more important than a lot of quality variation
in the final product can be attributed to quality variation in the raw product (and the variation
in quality intensifies for natural products). Standards and automatic measurement lead to an
increase in the accuracy of quality test.

Before the implementation of standards, a sample of the raw material was taken and tested
for characteristics. Now each piece entering the production process is automatically tested so
that the quality of the product is known at every step of the process. This way, the production
process can be adjusted in order to prevent from a variation in the quality of the final
product. This improvement in measurement-related procedures and processes led to a better
quality of the final product but also to a more accurate description. This example thus shows
how investing in measurement capacities reduces the market failure induced by information
asymmetries.

Another source of uncertainty encountered by economic agents is environmental by nature.
Environmental uncertainty refers to all the unknowns about environmental parameters that
could influence profit. For instance, a wheat producer faces uncertainty concerning the future
demand for his product in the next few months, but also regarding the climatic conditions on
which his final supply depends. This kind of uncertainty leads to specific costs (insurance costs
for example), a decrease in productivity and a less efficient stock management.
Environmental risk often refers to this latest sense. Firms facing high environmental risks may
invest in an effective way to mitigate it, and legal metrology is key to that operation.

In a study for the Canadian standards-setting organisation (Haimowitz and Warren 2007), the
authors complete their econometric study with a case study of SaskPower, a full-service
Canadian utility. SaskPower registered to ISO 14001 3, a set of environmental standards.
According to SaskPower, standards adoption led to risk management benefits:

        “Overall, SaskPower believes that it is operating more efficiently as a result of
        implementing ISO 14001. These efficiencies have allowed SaskPower to do more things
        with the same resources and to do other things more diligently.”

The standards aim to reduce the environmental impact of the firm; they did not directly affect
the measurement system as in the Plasterboard case. The mechanism to explain how the firm
benefits from these standards is different: because the ISO registration implied limiting some
production spill overs that could affect external parameters which determine total profits, the
standards adoption resulted in higher productivity and a better adaptation to the company’s

 « The ISO 14000 family addresses various aspects of environmental management. It provides practical tools
for companies and organizations looking to identify and control their environmental impact and constantly
improve their environmental performance. ISO 14001:2004 and ISO 14004:2004 focus on environmental
management systems. The other standards in the family focus on specific environmental aspects such as life
cycle analysis, communication and auditing. » http://www.iso.org/iso/iso14000

environment. The impact of standards on these productivity gains are very difficult to
quantify because the factors are numerous and highly correlated. One should be careful when
assessing the isolated impact of standard adoption. This quantitative pitfall can be avoided by
qualitative examination (e.g. interviewing people involved in the standard adoption process):

       “In 2005, the most recent year for which data are available, SaskPower had 15
       reportable spills, which was slightly under the 5-year average. One might ask two
       questions: Was the result significantly positive[…] The decrease is probably indicative of
       a positive result because over the previous 5 years, SaskPower had added facilities and
       increased the number of employees all items which could be expected to increase the
       potential for spills. […] SaskPower is convinced that ISO 14001 implementation has
       definitely helped it to manage and avoid environmental risks. SaskPower believes that
       it has benefited significantly by implementing ISO 14001. Management has increased
       confidence that through the rigor of ISO 14001 and the discipline imposed around the
       identification of negative consequences, environmental risks are being identified and
       better managed. Risks have always been managed at SaskPower […] but since ISO
       14001 was implemented procedures have been improved, quality training is in place,
       and documentation and record keeping is better.”

By registering to the ISO standards set, SaskPower also improved its audit system. ISO 14001
includes requirements to define and communicate targets. The audit process has been
designed such as each negative result is followed by a procedure aiming at fixing the
malfunctions. This way, the company in the study was able to constantly improve its
production processes and its productivity.

ACCESS TO NEW MARKETS

An important benefit of standards mentioned in the literature is the opportunity to access
new markets. This can be done either by productivity gains allowing producers to take part in
a very competitive market or through the compliance to legal requirements necessary to
enter the market. In the same survey (Haimowitz and Warren 2007), the authors study the
case of INFASCO, a producer of standard steel fasteners playing a front role on the global
market. The conclusion of the authors is clear: the registration to ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 17025
accreditation enabled the firm to stay in business despite the highly competitive environment
implied by the presence of low-cost fasteners from emerging market countries.

The example of the Building sector in New Zealand reviewed by (Stokes, Dixon et al. 2011)
shows how investing in standards can help firms gain an interesting position in a particular
market. In this example, the national programme “Warm up New Zealand” produced benefits
for consumers using the insulation system:

       “Anyone who has a home built before 2000 is eligible for 33 percent off the cost of
       installing ceiling and under floor insulation up to a maximum of $1,300. Community
       Service cardholders can get 60 percent off the cost of installing insulation.”

                                               30
                                   OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

To be eligible, consumers have to choose a specific insulation system complying with a set of
requirements defined by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority. Building
companies offering equipment and installations fitting with these requirements thus have a
profitable position in the market since the demand for their goods and services increases. In
this particular case, the first company offering this insulation system has a quasi-monopolistic
position. To be able to sell this system at the time when the programme is implemented is
possible only if the companies invest in legal standards and even take part in the drafting
process at an early stage as consulted stakeholders.

Indeed, participation in standard design enables firms to achieve a good market position. In
(Shintaku, Ogawa et al. 2006), the authors focus on the electronics sector. The International
Electrotechnical Commission 4 gathers experts to discuss and develop new standards. To
explain how standard participation increase market share, the case of Tyco Electronics/AMP is
studied. This company produces connectors and interconnection systems. When deciding to
produce a new type of connector, firm representatives also joined the committees designing
the relevant standards. The idea was to influence the process to their advantage by
convincing other stakeholders of the superiority of their technology. Eventually, the new
connector was used to set the standard, giving Tyco Electronics/AMP a significant competitive
advantage on the markets they were operating in. Because this connector used a more
elaborated technology, the profit margin of the company also increased due to higher prices.
The authors quantified the gain induced by this new market share with the following results:

          “[…] in the period 1995-2004, the combination of better market share and better profit
          margins has provided Tyco/AMP with additional profits estimated to be in-between
          US$ 50 000 000 and US$ 100 000 000. Without the investment in standardization this
          probably would not have been feasible”.

Another case study by the same authors shows that, even if the company is not participating
in the standard-setting process, it can benefit from staying informed of the latest modification
in the legal metrology requirements or certification process. Intergraph produced software
and hardware goods. They conceived a computer for graphical applications and the keyboard
did not meet the international standard IEC 60073. Before the beginning of the keyboard
modification (which would have induced a cost of €19000 for only 1000 keyboards), a
member of the committee organization heard that the standards stopping them from
commercializing the product were being changed in a way allowing them to sell the
computers as they were. Being informed of this new element too late would have incurred
huge costs for the firm. In sectors such as Information Technology, standards evolve very
quickly and have a large impact on the company profits because network and spill overs
effects are omnipresent. It is then essential for firms to invest in standardisation, either by
taking a decisional part in it or by staying informed of the latest developments.

OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

We have seen how investing in and taking part legal metrology work can enable firms to
access new markets or keep the upper hand when legal requirements change. We will now
describe how standardisation can enable firms to create new markets in which they will have,
at least in the early stages of its development, a monopolistic position. Indeed, as (Swann
2000) shows, standards play an essential role in product diversity. Above, we have highlighted
the role of standards in fostering innovation. Swann builds a model to explain the impact of
standard on process innovation. The author uses a characteristic analysis in which products
are differentiated by the features they offer. Innovation leads to the development and
commercialization of new characteristics and then allows for an increase in diversity. Every
product can be located in a multidimensional space according to its characteristics. It is
important that consumers understand the location of products within this virtual space. Yet
this is only possible if sellers can provide accurate measurement about the product
characteristic. The model shows that “anything that expands the pool of feasible
measurements can be expected to expand the pool of feasible product characteristics”.
A main hypothesis of the model is that product innovation demonstrates “combinatorial
characters” in the sense that a new product is a new combination of feasible measurable
characteristics.

INFORMATION, QUALITY AND PRICE PREMIUM

We have mentioned before the role of asymmetric information in market failures. We will
now describe the nature of this market failure and explain how measurement standards can
help reduce it. In his famous article (Akerlof 1970), Akerlof illustrates adverse selection with
the example of second-hand cars. In this market, suppliers are car owners who try to sell their
cars. Buyers are looking for a car but they are facing a risk induced by the lack of information
about the quality of the car offered. The buyers face the risk of buying a defective car. Taking
this risk into account, they lower their reservation price (i.e. the maximum price they are
willing to pay for their second-hand car). Sellers of high quality cars are not interested in
selling anymore with too low a price and are driven out of the market. Only sellers of low
quality cars remain: this phenomenon is referred to as adverse selection.

Asymmetric information leads to market failure in the extent that some buyers were able to
buy a high quality car for a higher price but the transaction does not occur because of this
lack of information on the buyers’ part. This means that the satisfaction of buyers and sellers
would have been higher if the information was perfect. Asymmetric information is a widely
studied research topic in economics and measurement standards appear to be an effective
answer to this market failure. This is the proposition put forward by (Swann 2009). According
to the author, measurement standards do not only achieve market failure reduction but also
allow firms to receive a price premium when they produce better quality goods. This
mechanism leads to a higher average quality of the products offered. As we explained before,
these kinds of standards allow producers to commercialize new products or better quality
products. This investment in research and this improvement in quality are costly for the


                                              32
                                    OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

producer, who is incentivised to do so only if he expects his new product to meet a
substantial demand.

Consumers who are offered innovative goods know they are taking a risk by buying: it may
not be compatible with other, related goods (in the case of telecommunications, furniture or
appliances, for instance); understanding all his functionalities may induce an information cost
or it may simply not match the consumer’s taste since the good is new on the market and has
few recommendations from peers. It is then essential for producers to reduce the risk faced
by consumers buying their commodities. An efficient way to mitigate this is to provide the
consumers with more information about the product. Once the information about the
innovative product is disseminated, consumers may agree to pay a higher price for a higher
quality good; the producer receive a premium existing only as long as information is easily
available thanks to standard measurements.

So far we have examined the benefits of norms and measurement standards from the
producer’s point of view. We will now complete this analysis with a review of the
consequences for consumers.

BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS


INFORMATION, QUALITY ASSURANCE, NEW PRODUCTS

As we have seen before, legal metrology increases the amount of information available about
commercialized products. In turn, more accurate information facilitates innovation. Producers
can enter new markets or even create one where they may have a monopolistic position for a
time. This increase in the variety of available goods also improves consumers’ welfare. They
are more likely to find a product matching their taste and expectations, which augments their
utility. Here, we use the term “utility” in the sense given to it by the consumer choice theory.
Here is the simplest way to represent the utility associated with the purchase of a good 𝑖𝑖:

                                            𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 )

With 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 the quality of the good 𝑖𝑖 or any of its characteristic and the 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 the price of good 𝑖𝑖. The
function f is increasing in 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 and decreasing in 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 . It is also often assumed that utility is
increasing in the quality. Innovation would result in the production of a product with higher
quality or more features. Consumers will benefits from an increase in goods quality since
good quality is one of the main parameters determining their utility. The Dixit-Stiglitz model
(Dixit and Stiglitz 1977) of “love of variety” shows that consumer utility increases with enough
diversity of choice. The main hypothesis of this model is that products are horizontally
differentiated, meaning that they differ in their characteristics – which all consumers are
informed of.

In short, the hypothesis of perfect information about the products available on the market is
essential to microeconomic models. According to these models, consumer utility and welfare


                                                     33
OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

increase with the quality and diversity of products. As we have seen earlier, the
implementation of measurement standards and legal metrology requirements enable firms to
produce higher-quality goods and to commercialise new products. But for legal metrology to
increase total welfare, these standards and information about measurement rules and
instruments have to be available to consumers. In (Swann 2009), the author stresses this
point. He cites the work of (Bacharach 1990) who explains that even if economic studies
explain product characteristic as defined by producers and sellers, it is useful to adopt a
“customer-centred” view. According to P. Swann:

       “this customer-centred view makes it clear why measurement methods should be open
       to sellers and buyers alike”.

Investing time and money in in legal metrology and measurement may then benefit the entire
sector and the whole economy as long as the information about measured characteristic is
known to all economic agents. This is why private and public investment in legal metrology
enterprises are equally important to ensure economic growth and welfare.

SPILL OVER EFFECTS AND NETWORK EXTERNALITIES

There are other non-direct benefits of legal metrology and standards to consumers. In
sectors characterized by high network or spill over effects, metrological requirements can
have an even more important effect on total welfare. The study of the Building Sector in New
Zealand (Stokes, Dixon et al. 2011) shows that the increase in the quality of installations and
insulation system also benefits households living in residential buildings. Furthermore, as the
people installing this insulation scheme increase, the quality of the service offered by the
building companies increase too:

       “Between July 2009 and March 2011, 91,506 households have taken advantage of the
       home insulation and heating scheme. At least 10 percent of these households have
       been audited. There has been a huge increase in the quality of the installation of the
       insulation due to training by the Insulation Association of New Zealand related to NZS
       4246:2006.”Quote from Tim Mahar, Senior Technical Advisor, Energy Efficiency and
       Conservation Authority

IMPACT OF MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY

One important aspect of measurement that can benefit both consumers and producers is the
methodology it uses. Indeed, as we have seen in the case study of the plasterboard sector,
comprehensive and integrated measurements on the raw materials help to improve the
production process and thus increase the final product quality. This increase in quality
benefits producers and consumers alike if the product price is not too high. The possibility of
a price too high for the supply to meet its demand is reduced by the increase in efficiency (as
economic theory presents prices as highly correlated with productivity) made possible by
standardisation. For some sectors, it is not possible to measure the characteristics of every

                                              34
                                       OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

      single input: this is why the sample methodology is an important component of the firm’s
      measurement strategy.

      In (CIE 2006) the authors study sampling methods in the mining sector. When a transaction
      for selling minerals occurs, estimations about the mineral content have to be made in order
      to determine the price and quantity to be sold. It would be too costly to measure the content
      of each mineral, so only a sample of mineral is selected to be tested. The way this sample is
      chosen will determine the accuracy of the estimation. Producers have to choose the right
      statistical strategy since more accurate sampling would allow the seller to negotiate a higher
      price than otherwise. For the buyer, this would reduce the information asymmetry he faces in
      these kinds of transactions. The authors focus next on the gains in terms of profits for the
      producer when the supply increases. Their model depends on an estimation of supply and
      demand responsiveness (represented by the slope of the curve in figure 1). They estimate an
      average benefit of $58 million per year for the concerned industries.

VI)   MODELLING THE MICROECONOMIC IMPACT OF MEASUREMENT

      We will now build a model for quantifying the impact of measurement on the producers’
      profits. Because we want to focus on the benefits conformity to legal metrology requirements
      brings to the profit of producers, we won’t include the costs induced by standard adoption or
      measurement investment at every step of the modelling. Instead we included a parameter for
      the cost of the whole operation of following legal metrology requirements. This model aims
      to explain profit by the factors most commonly used, as underlined in the literature review.
      Our methodology is inspired by producer microeconomic theory, which defines the
      maximisation program for producers as follows:


                                                   35

cost function. This very simple representation helps to understand producer strategies. On
the one hand, he wants to produce more because his profit is an increasing function of the
quantity sold. On the other hand the cost is an increasing function of the quantity produced
(second part of the equation). Under some hypothesis on the functional form of F(.) and C(.),
this profit function presents a maximum defining the optimal amount of input to use which
then defines the optimal produced quantity.

If we include the constraint into the objective function, we obtain this program:

                              𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑥𝑥     Π = 𝑝𝑝. 𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) − 𝐶𝐶(𝑥𝑥)
The mechanisms explaining the link between standard adoption, measurement improvement
and profit increase have been listed before. We will include them in the production and cost
functions step by step in order to get a comprehensive model embodying the economic
effects of legal metrology and standardisation on producers’ profits. Here, the cost function
includes the costs induced by the production of the goods as well as all the other costs
producers face during the sale proceeding. This approach is slightly different from the
standard microeconomic framework where, in a perfect competition environment, there are
no transaction costs and the price is the only adjustment mechanism between supply and
demand.

This simple model will allow us to make a first step in trying to quantify the impact of legal
metrology on profit. As we have explained before, the absence of a counterfactual prevents
us from computing the benefits of legal metrology in monetary units. Yet, we can still
translate how legal metrology work affects profit into a microeconomic model.




TRANSACTION COSTS

One of the essential benefits provided by standards and measurement is the decrease in costs
incurred by firms. As we have explained, standards can reduce transaction costs by various
means. For instance the input 𝑥𝑥 needed to produce the good 𝑦𝑦 can be provided by an
external supplier. In this case, the producer might need to establish a contract to schedule a
weekly delivery, for instance. The producer then faces what we have called policing and
enforcement costs to make sure the supplier behaves according to the contract. There are
different ways to include these costs in the profit function. We assume that policing and
enforcement costs can be proportionate to the quantity of inputs to be acquired by the
producer. For these situations, we can elaborate a factor 𝑡𝑡1 strictly positive and multiply it by
the quantity of goods 𝑥𝑥. This parameter encapsulates all the variable costs, increasing with
the quantity produced. Thus, the cost function becomes:

                                                 36
                                     OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY



                                             𝐶𝐶(𝑥𝑥) = 𝑡𝑡1 . 𝑥𝑥

Search and information costs as well as bargaining costs are conditional to the transaction
and they don’t necessarily increase with the quantity traded. They can be included in the cost
function as a fixed cost, which means adding an additive factor to the cost function:

                                          𝐶𝐶(𝑥𝑥) = 𝑡𝑡1 . 𝑥𝑥 + 𝑡𝑡2

According to the standard industrial economy, in the short run, the only variable producers
can choose is the quantity 𝑥𝑥 used to produce the output 𝑦𝑦. However, in the long run,
producers can choose the technology they use (ie. modifying the production function). For
example, investing in a new machine improves the technology by modifying the labour/capital
ratio of their production. As we have seen before, the adoption of a new standard can reduce
transaction costs. Consequently 𝑡𝑡1 or 𝑡𝑡2 could decrease to 𝑡𝑡1′ and 𝑡𝑡2′ with 𝑡𝑡1′ < 𝑡𝑡1 and 𝑡𝑡2′ < 𝑡𝑡2 .
Since profit is decreasing with cost, this would increase profit.

                 Π ′ = 𝑝𝑝. 𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) − 𝑡𝑡1′ . 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑡𝑡2′ > Π = 𝑝𝑝. 𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) − 𝑡𝑡1 . 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑡𝑡2
Besides, investment and participation in legal metrology processes from standard-setting to
verification is a good way to avoid future costs. If the firm’s technology anticipates the norm,
this firm won’t have to incur additional costs to comply with the standard. In the producer
maximisation program, this has to be included in future profits and again in the inter-
temporal profit function that we will develop in the following section.

PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE


THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION

We have explained the mechanisms by which standards can improve productivity. In the
Plasterboard case study (Swann 2009), a better knowledge of raw product quality led to a
more adequate use of the production process. To take this into account in our maximisation
program, we assume that producers can now chose the production function 𝐹𝐹(. ) by deciding
to adopt a standard or to buy more accurate equipment.

Now about the details of the production function. The economic literature uses a production
function to model the transformation of inputs into outputs. The more general form is simply
given by:

                                       𝑦𝑦 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥1 , 𝑥𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 )

Where 𝑥𝑥1 , 𝑥𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 are the different input quantities used. The production function gives the
maximum production level obtained by the different combinations of production factors, with
a given technology. Usually, two main kinds of inputs are considered: labour (𝐿𝐿) and capital
(𝐾𝐾) and then

                                             𝑦𝑦 = 𝑓𝑓(𝐿𝐿, 𝐾𝐾)



Usually in economics, the production function is defined as a Cobb-Douglas function and
takes the following form:

                                             𝑦𝑦 = 𝐴𝐴𝐾𝐾 𝛼𝛼 𝐿𝐿𝛽𝛽

Where A is a technology parameter, 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 are parameters for, respectively, capital and
labour productivity. Their relation to one indicates the form of the returns to scale.

      If 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 = 1, returns to scale are constant,

      If 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 > 1, returns to scale are increasing,

      If 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 < 1, returns to scale are decreasing.

        STANDARDS AND PRODUCTIVITY

        In the examples we have described above, an improvement in measurement (due to
        standards or investment) means better inputs use (e.g. capital) meaning in turn that 𝛼𝛼
        increases. Similarly, standards adoption can improve labour quality (as it may be the case with
        management standards) and in turn increase the 𝛽𝛽 parameter. The global productivity factor
        𝐴𝐴 can also be affected by conformity to legal metrology requirements. Indeed, this parameter
        reflects the efficiency of production techniques. When 𝐴𝐴 increases, the combination of
        production factors is more effective (more can be produced with the same quantity). This
        parameter reflects technological progress.

                                                                  The firm will use the production function and

        labour, that produce the same quantity.

curve) this one will be the most efficient combination of inputs.

The parameters of the production
function determine the isoquant
curves. If one parameter of the
function changes, the shapes of
those curves will be altered. When
𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 increase, the shape of the
isoquants changes. When 𝛼𝛼
increases, the isoquant curve
changes as shown in figure 5: less

                                                            produce the quantity 𝑄𝑄0 with the
                                                            same quantity of capital.

production could come from an improvement in equipment, leading in turn to a decrease in
the proportion of labour used. This would mean an increase in productivity with a
modification of the 𝛼𝛼 parameter. The introduction of a new standard in management
practices could increase the 𝛽𝛽 parameter. Finally the adoption of a new technology could
raise the parameter for global productivity, 𝐴𝐴. Since metrological requirements – and
specifically harmonization in legal metrology – facilitate the development and the diffusion of
innovations, we can assume that standards boost global productivity.

We have developed the functional form of the production function and underlined how
standards and measurement improvement could influence its parameters. A change in these
parameters 𝐴𝐴, 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 leads directly to an increase in profit through higher productivity.



              Π ′ = 𝑝𝑝. 𝐹𝐹 ′(𝑥𝑥) − 𝑡𝑡1 . 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑡𝑡2 > Π = 𝑝𝑝. 𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) − 𝑡𝑡1 . 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑡𝑡2

                                    𝐹𝐹 ′ (𝑥𝑥) = 𝐴𝐴′𝐾𝐾 𝛼𝛼′ 𝐿𝐿𝛽𝛽′

                                          𝑥𝑥 = (𝐾𝐾, 𝐿𝐿)


Where at least one of the parameters 𝛼𝛼 ′ , 𝛽𝛽′ and 𝐴𝐴′ is different from its value before the
improvement in conformity or the standard adoption.

PRICE INCREASE

We have explained the microeconomics foundations of the benefits legal metrology entails
when considering the production and cost functions. Another channel through which
conformity to standards bring gains to producers is the price. In a situation of perfect
competition, producers are price-takers: they cannot influence prices. Modern
microeconomics now considers different types of market configurations and examines
situations where firms do influence the prices.

QUALITY INCREASE

The most obvious way by which firms can obtain a higher price for their products is an
increase in their quality. Indeed, price can be defined as a function of the quality of the
product (𝑞𝑞) and others demand parameters (included in the 𝑧𝑧 factor).

                                         𝑝𝑝 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑞𝑞, 𝑧𝑧)
We assume here that the price is an increasing function of the quality. We can imagine for
example that the adoption of an environmental standard would guarantee a lower
environmental impact, a quality valued by at least some consumers. Firms that enforce this
standard can legitimately ask a higher price for it.

                                                41
OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

Another illustration is the Plasterboard case developed before. Because producers can adjust
their production process to the quality and characteristics of the raw products, the quality of
final product is eventually better. Thus:

                              𝑝𝑝′ = 𝑓𝑓(𝑞𝑞′, 𝑧𝑧) > 𝑝𝑝 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑞𝑞, 𝑧𝑧)
A higher price means a higher mark-up which is the difference between the cost of the good
and its selling price.




QUALITY CERTAINTY

A higher price can only be applied if the higher quality is recognized by consumers, which is
not certain in the absence of perfect information. Standards can then act as a signal for
quality. Including this mechanism in our model implies we define price as a function of the
quality, of the information available about the product (the parameter 𝑖𝑖) and other demand
parameters:

                                         𝑝𝑝 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑞𝑞, 𝑖𝑖, 𝑧𝑧)
The use of publicly known standards increases the knowledge of consumers about the
product which leads to a higher price:

                            𝑝𝑝′ = 𝑓𝑓(𝑞𝑞, 𝑖𝑖 ′ , 𝑧𝑧) > 𝑝𝑝 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑞𝑞, 𝑖𝑖, 𝑧𝑧)
Indeed, as previously explained, better sampling methods can enhance the bargaining power
of suppliers during the price-setting process. Facing a more accurate measure of the
characteristics and quantity of the product, the buyer cannot pass on the cost induced by an
uncertainty about the product onto the price.

In addition, the adoption of standards may allow producers access to new markets.
Conformity to health, safety and quality standards, for example, may be necessary to sell on a
regulated market, from food products to aeronautics. Adoption of standards could also be
necessary to survive in a market facing a high supply shock such as the introduction of low-
cost products. We illustrated this mechanism with the example of the steel fasteners market
(Haimowitz and Warren 2007) where the INFASCO Company managed to survive the new
competitive environment induced by the abundance of low-cost fastener from producers
based in developing countries.

The increase in quality and information on the product generates a vertical differentiation of
products on the same market. Vertical differentiation occurs when the different goods of a
market differ from their quality. In the case of differentiation induced by new standards, the
price can differ from the perfect competition price but the underlined mechanisms are
different: a new variety arises from innovation, enhanced by standards. Then the producer of


                                                 42
                                      OIML E 7:2015(E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

this new variety can benefit from a quasi-monopolistic position in this new market, at least in
the short run.

In addition, with certification of quality, information asymmetries are reduced, decreasing the
level of adverse selection. Then the average quality on the market increases because the
average price is now higher. Our maximisation programme becomes:



               Π ′ = 𝑝𝑝′ . 𝐹𝐹 ′(𝑥𝑥) − 𝑡𝑡1 . 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑡𝑡2 > Π = 𝑝𝑝. 𝐹𝐹(𝑥𝑥) − 𝑡𝑡1 . 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑡𝑡2

                                          𝐹𝐹 ′ (𝑥𝑥) = 𝐴𝐴′𝐾𝐾 𝛼𝛼′ 𝐿𝐿𝛽𝛽′

                                            𝑝𝑝′ = 𝑝𝑝(𝑞𝑞 ′ , 𝑖𝑖 ′ , 𝑧𝑧)

                                                𝑥𝑥 = (𝐾𝐾, 𝐿𝐿)



SOCIAL WELFARE

To understand the benefits brought by conformity to standards and metrological
improvements, we need to consider the social welfare, i.e. the sum of consumers’ surplus and
producers’ profit. We define 𝑊𝑊 the global social welfare in a particular market.

                    𝑊𝑊 = � Π(p, q, t1 , 𝑡𝑡2 , 𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽, 𝐴𝐴, 𝑥𝑥, 𝑖𝑖) + � 𝑈𝑈(𝑝𝑝, 𝑥𝑥, 𝑞𝑞, 𝑖𝑖, 𝑛𝑛)

The profit parameters have already been defined. The price, quantity, quality and information
also have an impact on the consumer’s utility, as explained in Part III. The consumer’s utility is
thus represented by U, a function depending on the price, the quantity and quality of the
product consumed. Additionally, the variety of products available, 𝑛𝑛, positively impacts their
utility. Standard adoption and measurement improvement can thus increase social welfare as
long as the cost of the standard implementation or conformity does not offset its benefits.
We could add to this welfare function a cost parameter that would model the overall
spending induced by the creation and implementation process of standard. This cost
parameter is Cs in the following equation. Policy makers would thus have to maximise the
following objective program:

                 𝑊𝑊 = � Π(p, q, t1 , 𝑡𝑡2 , 𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽, 𝐴𝐴, 𝑥𝑥, 𝑖𝑖) + � 𝑈𝑈(𝑝𝑝, 𝑥𝑥, 𝑞𝑞, 𝑖𝑖, 𝑛𝑛) − 𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠



Here, we have not specified the repartition of the costs of the standards and legal metrology
operations. A more complete model would describe the strategy of each economic agent and



                                                       43

examine which actors bear which costs in conformity assessment, standardization or
measurement traceability, for example.

Testing this theoretical model requires data on all the factors mentioned above. Since this
data was not available at the time of the report we choose to focus on a specific feature of
legal metrology: the definition and the harmonisation of the maximum permissible error of
measuring instruments used for trade.

VII)   CASE STUDIES: ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE ERROR
       REQUIREMENTS IN THE AUSTRALIAN WHEAT, COAL AND SUGAR INDUSTRIES

       One of the most central aspects of legal metrology is defining reference procedures for
       measurements. As we saw before, a lot of efforts have been put into choosing and having all
       Parties agree to specific units of measurements. Maximum permissible errors (MPE)
       associated with these units have been defined by international metrology organisations such
       as the OIML.

       In our cases, the product characteristics concerning quality and quantity are numerous and
       diverse. To simplify, we will consider only one of those features: weight. Legal metrology
       defines guidelines and methods of enforcement regarding weight measurement in
       transactions. When a producer sells his product to a buyer, these two Parties establish a
       contract defining the quantity traded (in our case, weight). Whenever the shipment doesn’t
       comply with the terms of the contract, it implies new costs. If the quantity delivered is
       superior to the one agreed on, the seller will suffer a loss proportionate to the surplus given
       for free. On the contrary, if the quantity delivered is inferior to the one agreed, the buyer may
       ask for compensation. Even more problematic, the seller’s reputation could suffer an
       intangible loss from this bad client experience.

       Legal metrology defines maximum permissible errors for measuring instruments according to
       the nominal quantity to weigh. By doing so, legal metrology facilitates the act of contracting.
       The accuracy of the measurements depends on the quality of the measuring instruments
       used. This parameter is the first element we have to take into account. From this quality will
       follow the accuracy of the quantity sold.

       SELECTING AN EXISTING MODEL AS A STARTING POINT

       In order to quantify the economic impact of legal metrology we focus on one of its aspects
       only: the definition of the MPE. In the following, we develop a methodology for estimating
       the economic impact of having MPE fixed by regulations in the context of specific industries.
       Our starting point for this model is the very interesting article of T. Usuda and A. Henson
       (Usuda and Henson 2012). Hence, we will begin with an explanation of their impact study.

       The fundamental idea of the authors is that products are distributed according to their
       characteristics and quality. All products have to pass a conformity check before being sold.
       Producers determine the accepted quality interval with lower and upper testing limits. If the
       product belongs to this interval, it will be shipped to a client.

             Figure 8: Conformity assessment. Source: (Usuda and Henson 2012)

In Figure 1 a normal distribution of the product quality is assumed. Lower and upper testing
limits are represented respectively by LTL and ULT and the products that pass the conformity
assessment are those that fall within the interval defined by those testing limits. In general,
this interval is the result of negotiations between buyers and sellers. For instance, a miller
selling his flour to a bakery has to establish a contract defining the quantity, price and
frequency of the sales. This contract may take into account error measurements. Let’s say the
miller delivers a 50 kg bag of flour every two days. The contract may then indicate that every
bag weighting between 49.8 kg and 50.2 kg complies with the contract conditions. In that
case, the seller should calibrate his measuring instruments accordingly and make sure the
measurement error doesn’t exceed 0.2 kg. If the testing limit is not regulated by law, the
seller will set it himself and face a trade-off between buyer satisfaction and production cost
(more accuracy in measurement requires investment).

When the testing limit is not legally enforced, it may differ from sellers to buyers. Thus, in
some cases, products that passed the seller’s conformity assessment might not pass the one
of the buyer (false positive). Symmetrically, some products that would have passed the
buyer’s conformity test won’t be sold (and might be lost) because they weren’t in the seller’s
conformity interval (false negative). This idea is represented in the following figure at three
stages of an export/import transaction:

Figure 9: Additional loss due to deviation of measurement standards between an exporter and
                             an importer. (Usuda and Henson 2012)

As described in Figure 8 a deviation 𝜖𝜖 in the measurement standard (for the buyer in the top
part of the figure) causes false positive and false negative products. This results in additional
costs. If we assume a normal distribution of the products over the quality characteristics, we
need to take the integral under the distribution function as in the top part of the graph
(respectively circled in orange and blue) in order to derive the percentages of false negatives
and false positives. It is important to note that the proportion of false positives is higher than
the proportion of false negatives. It means that the loss associated with false positives and
false negatives are not equal. Here, the distribution function of the shipped product will be
used to derive the costs associated with this difference in testing limits. Legal metrology, by
harmonizing testing limits, helps preventing such cases where buyer’s and seller’s conformity
assessments are markedly disparate. International coordination is crucial to avoid these types
of divergence between importers and exporters.

The authors develop a methodology to derive the economic impact of the equivalence of
measurement standards. They examine the industry of the analytical balance in Japan and
assume that 99.9 % of the balanced produced passed the conformity test of the producers.

OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

The conformity test used is the one defined by the OIML, stating that the masses used to
check the accuracy of the balances must not be in error by more than one third of the
maximum permissible error (MPE) of the instrument. The authors take the MPE of the 1 kg
mass standard for the class F1 where the MPE is 5 mg. The mass used for the test must not be
over or under 1.67 mg of the nominal value, 1 kg. Assuming that 99.9 % of the balances
produced fall into the test limits defined by this conformity assessment, the distribution of
the analytical balances produced is described in the following figure:




            Figure 9 The distribution of analytical balances. (Usuda and Henson 2012)

The authors estimated that with the actual measurement uncertainty the Japanese balance
industry only suffers a loss of ¥6.6 million, corresponding to less than 0.04 % of its annual
turnover. With higher deviation of the metrology standard, Japan would suffer higher loss: for
example with a deviation of 0.5 mg of the standards, the loss would be of ¥197 million (a little
more than 1 % of annual turnover). In addition to this loss on the balance industry turnover,
the loss in other industries due to the uncertainty over balance measurement can also be
estimated. Usuda and Henson take the example of the platinum industry and postulate that
the loss due to variation in MPEs is proportionate to the price per unit.



 The economic impact of a deviation in standard for industries using this measure instrument
is given by the following equation:
                           Δ−𝜖𝜖                                             𝛥𝛥

Where 𝜖𝜖 is the deviation, 𝑓𝑓(𝑚𝑚 − 𝑥𝑥)is the loss function for a deviation of x compared to the
aimed nominal value, 0. In addition 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 is the quantity of product in the industry (here the

platinum industry). Finally the fraction 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 represents the proportion of balances with an
error of x. This equation computes the proportion of false positive (due to the deviation)
minus the proportion of false negative (due to the deviation). The false positive and false
negative product multiplied by the economic loss they create. The following figure allows
visualizing those proportions. In this figure, the economic impact is the grey shaded area of
the top part of the figure, minus the grey shaded area of the bottom part of the figure:




 Figure 10 The loss associated with a deviation of measurement standards, assuming a normal
             distribution of the measuring instrument. (Usuda and Henson 2012)

One can observe that the loss with deviation of measurement standards is higher than if they
are identical. So the economic impact associated with a deviation 𝜖𝜖 of the measurement
standard depends on the additional fraction of products that results in false positives and
false negatives compared to the situation without deviation.

In addition the loss function is assumed to be directly proportionate to the price per unit that
is denoted by P in the following equation:
                        Δ−𝜖𝜖                                                    𝛥𝛥

When applied to the Japanese platinum industry, this method results in an estimated
potential economic loss of USD228 600 dollars for a deviation of 0.5 mg. In the following
section, we develop a similar model to show that legal metrology prevents similar economic
loss for industries in Australia.




APPLICATION TO THE AUSTRALIAN WHEAT, SUGAR AND COAL INDUSTRIES

In this section we use the model developed by Usuda and Henson (Usuda and Henson 2012)
as a starting point to estimate the economic loss induced by a divergence between the
maximum permissible error in key Australian industries and their counterparts in importing
countries. The main reason for using this model being that it is a better fit for the available
data. Ultimately, the results attest of the need for international harmonization in legal
metrology. We consider three sectors: sugar, coal and wheat. Those industries are of
particular interest since Australia in 2012-2013 exported 68 % of its wheat production (22
million tons), 54 % of its coal (481 million tons mined) and 11 % of its sugar (30 million tons
produced). Over such quantities in large-scale industries, small variations in the maximum
permissible errors can lead to an economic impact definitely not negligible. The figures used
in this section have been provided by the OIML.

We focus on import-export relations because variation of national metrology norms can lead
to variation in the MPE. As we described above, deviations in the MPE from those used by the
importer to those of the exporter, false positive and false negative errors in measurement can
take place. In the case of weight, a false positive would consist in the shipment of a quantity
lower than the one agreed on in the contract. The missing quantity would weight more than
authorized by the MPE of the measuring instrument used by the importer. In that case, the
exporter would have to compensate the importer financially. However, a false negative would
be beneficial for the exporter since they would be able to ship less than previously arranged
and still submit to the contractual conditions (see Fig. 2).

We will first reproduce the analysis developed by (Usuda and Henson 2012) by studying the
economic impact of a divergence between the MPEs. We will then suggest a model that could
estimate the economic impact of having higher or lower MPE in the measuring instrument
used for trade. Those two estimations relate to the benefits of legal metrology since the MPEs
are regulatory standards and their enforcement falls into the domain of legal metrology. The
traded quantities we examine are weighted by weighbridges or belt conveyors. The legally
authorized MPE are stipulated in the Australian National Trade Measurement Regulation
[NMT Regs 1 Jan 2013 p134-148]. We will focus on exports from the three industries
considered. The following tables summarize the information we have on those exports.

CALCULATING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF DIVERGING MPE

We start with the sugar industry and will apply the same method to the other industries.
Considering the quantity of raw sugar exported, the MPE is 0.1 % when using weighbridges. It
implies that a measuring instrument with an accuracy of 0.1 % must be used for the
transaction to happen. For a quantity of one tonne, the authorized margin of error is 1 kg. If
we consider a quantity of one kg, the MPE would be +/- 1g. As did the authors in our base
study, we estimate the economic impact of a difference in the MPEs of the seller and the
buyer. The aim is to estimate the economic consequences of the importer and the exporter
not having harmonized MPEs. The exporter could have a -0.1 %/+0.1 % maximum
permissible error and the importer a MPE of (− 0.1 − 𝜖𝜖) %/ (0.1 − 𝜖𝜖) %.

The following illustration represents this deviation (between purple and green intervals) and
the false positives and negatives that ensue (respectively in red and orange).




                                     Amount specified

OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY




As we mentioned before, false positives are associated with an economic loss for the exporter
whereas false negatives constitute a gain. Therefore, in order to estimate the loss from MPE
disparity we need to subtract the proportion of false negative to the proportion of false
positive. We saw that, with a normal distribution of the instruments, those two proportions
are not equal and the proportion of false positive tends to be bigger. The model built here
allows estimating the economic impact of some legal metrology requirements. More
precisely, it considers the economic benefits of fixing common MPE (and their enforcement
modalities) for measurements instrument used for trade in exporting and importing
countries.

The legal MPE for weighbridges is +/- 1 kg per tonne. Following (Usuda and Henson 2012), we
consider that weighbridges, when built and inspected, are tested with masses of 1 ton for
which the measure uncertainty is no more than one third of the MPE. We obtain a Δ that
represent the possible measurement error of the weighbridge. So the quantity measured by
the exporter will have an accuracy of +/- Δ, times the numbers of tons. If the importer has a
deviation 𝜖𝜖 in his MPE compared to that of the exporter, then the economic impact of such
deviation (the loss) will be:
                                               Δ−𝜖𝜖                                   𝛥𝛥
         𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑄𝑄𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ���          𝐷𝐷(𝑥𝑥 − 𝜖𝜖) . |0 − 𝑥𝑥|𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑� − �� 𝐷𝐷(𝑥𝑥) |0 − 𝑥𝑥|𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑��
                                          −Δ−𝜖𝜖                                      −𝛥𝛥




This equation gives the proportion of false positive minus the proportion of false negative. We
multiply the result by the quantity and by the price since we assume that the
producer/exporter incurs a cost equal to the price for each false positive (and reciprocally a
gain equal to the price for each false negative). The next table summarizes the result for the
Sugar industry:

A small deviation between the Australian and the foreign MPEs (10 % of the Australian MPE)
would cause AUD 40 888 of damages.

We apply exactly the same method on the Wheat Industry and derive an economic loss of
AUD 65 293.

The method is similar in the Coal industry but since it is not the same measuring instrument
that is used, the initial MPE is not the same. The larger MPE results in a higher economic loss:
indeed a deviation of 10 % of the initial MPE would lead to an economic loss of more than
one million of Australian dollars.

The economic impacts that we estimated were caused by a deviation of the testing limits
between the exporter (Australia) and the importer (rest of the world). This deviation can be
expressed as a geometric translation of the testing interval to the right. We now consider the
case when it is the amplitude of the MPEs that differs: for example if the Australian economy
had a larger MPE interval than the rest of the world.




ECONOMIC IMPACT OF A LARGER PERMISSIBLE ERROR INTERVAL

Legal metrology produces rules and enforcement dispositions to maintain a uniform
measurement system nation-wide. In Australia, the National Trade Measurement legislation
[NTP Regs 1] defines the characteristics weighbridges and belt conveyors must possess in
order to be used in trade measurement. The penalties for non-conformity to these rules are
stipulated as well. The measurement infrastructure and more specifically the legal
requirements on the accuracy of the measuring instruments used for trade are also defined
so as to benefit international trade, notably by eliminating technical barriers to trade.

To further analyse the economic benefits of legal metrology, we will now turn to the benefit
of having a given MPE value enforced by legal metrology authorities. We assume that the
Australian MPE used for trade in Sugar and Wheat transactions is 0.2 % (so twice the current
value) and that the one used by the importers is 0.1 %. This gap may come, in our


                                               53
OIML E 7:2015 (E) MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF METROLOGY

hypothetical case, from lack of enforcement for more accurate weighting devices in Australia.
The difference in MPEs is described in the following figure where the green lines represent
the importers MPE and the violet line the Australian MPE:
                                           Amount specified

                                           − 0.2 %/ 0.2 %



The red area in the figure represents false positive but the orange one is yet another type of
false positive: the act of sending more quantity than needed. This second type of false
positive is also a loss for the producer since their MPE leads them to send more than sold. To
derive the loss they suffer due to this larger MPE we now need to compute the sum of the
two false positives.

Indeed the Australian Industry will suffer losses from both types: there will be cases where
the quantity weighed will be in accordance to the contract when weighted on an Australian
weight instrument but will be revealed to be not in accordance to the contract when
weighted on international weight instruments (due to the different MPEs). The red area
represents the cases where the quantity weighted on Australian instruments was found to be
conforming to the contract but international weighing instruments revealed that there was
not a sufficient amount, meaning that the exporter would have to give monetary
compensation to the importer since the quantity defined in the contract was not achieved.
The orange area in the figure represents the case where a more accurate weigh instrument
would have allowed the exporter to send a lesser amount that would still have conformed to
the contract. The difference between the amount actually sent and the lesser amount that
could have been sent with more accurate instruments is a loss for the exporter (he gave free
quantities to the importer).

The equation determining the economic loss associated with a less accurate MPE is:
                                                 Δ+𝜖𝜖                              𝛥𝛥

It corresponds to the proportion of quantity falling in the orange or red area in the

quantity.

The impact of a less accurate MPE is superior to the effect of a unilateral deviation in the
MPEs. We estimate that AUD 489 503 would be lost each year for the Wheat industry if the
Australian measurement infrastructure was not as accurate as it currently is (In reality it is of
0.05 %).




Finally, if we consider the Coal industry, the impact becomes considerable:

Table 9 Economic impact of a less accurate MPE on the Australian Coal industry

The annual impact would be around an annual AUD 9 million for the Coal industry. The annual
impact on all the industries combined is AUD 9 697 377,4.

CONCLUSION

The goal of this report was to review the literature on the economics of metrology and
standards and provide elements for modelling the economic benefits of legal metrology.
Macroeconomics benefits – to growth, productivity and innovation – are identified, as well as
a way to assess the benefits of legal metrology activities – testing, verification, and
international harmonization. But as we learned from the history of legal metrology, it
expanded from its original applications in science and industry and now forms the backbone
of domestic and international trade, as well as a powerful channel connecting policy and
trade. The benefits of legal metrology have to be approached by multiple angles.

From a policy standpoint, it is clear that investing in legal metrology research, enforcement
and infrastructure impacts growth positively. From the customer perspective as well, since
legal metrology requirements provide certainty in quality and safety along with an increased
choice of products. Evidently, the benefits of metrology for producers are plenty, but those
entailed by legal metrology regulation have been under less scrutiny. They are thought to be
substantial, as our model indicates, and rely to a large extend on the international
harmonization of legal metrology standards. It would now be interesting to extend our
theoretical model and test it with the appropriate data. Another improvement would be to
include the costs induced by legal metrology spending in this model.

The fundamental benefit of legal metrology is that it is a network technology in itself. When
enforced homogeneously on a market or territory, it accelerates and simplifies commercial
transactions, all Parties benefitting from more comparability, traceability and trust. It is no
wonder legal metrology was both a product and a precursor of the industrial revolutions of
the past centuries. Faced with new advances in technology but also new challenges posed by
globalization and the threat of environmental collapse, legal metrology is continuously
adapting.
